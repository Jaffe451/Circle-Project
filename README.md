# Circle-Project

	This project was created for my software engineering project class in the spring of 2018.
	It was updated in the fallowing summer with some UI and menu improvments during my Human Computer Interaction class

	Currently the project is unfinished:
		The level editor has no functionality
		The pog creator can not save finished pogs and has some crashes on exiting
		The base game is playable although some of the menuing is confusing at times
